        <p>Hello, World! I'm David Harper. I'm a student at BYU-Idaho. I am majoring in Cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing the Cello, reading History/Theology/Gospel-Scholarship, and playing computer games.</p>
        <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life, but was only really converted just prior to my mission.</p>
        <p>My favorite Church quote: “I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else—all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty” (Joseph Smith: History of the Church, 5:401).</p>
